title: New Intentions
---

It's crazy to think that I haven't posted to this site in over a year, and how much has changed in the Javascript world.  

* Meteor seems to be on it's last leg, though they seem to be trying to position it as a framework for React views.  
* React rules the world!  Well, not really, but it seems that way if you go on twitter, podcasts, or blog posts.
* Angular 2.0 is coming, but are they trying to do too much before the release?  It seems like there's been such a long wait for 2.0, but how long have we really been waiting.  
* node is so big now, and seems to be the way that many are using (including our company) for all of their back-end server work.
* My interest in Grunt seems mis-guided too, as Gulp appears to have won the "compiler" wars, though Babel may be still relevant in this argument.

So, what to do?

* Stay focused on node, which is easy at my current role
* As we get closer to production on our project, we'll likely have to use a compiler and I'll be able to pick up on that.
* React, React, React.  Gone through Tyler McGinnis' tutorial and I'm involved in the MEAP of React Quickly.  
* Pause on Angular and the additional "script" options like Coffeescript, etc.    
* Docker's another good focus as well as Docker to AWS.  AWS is so prevelant that I need to learn it inside and out.
