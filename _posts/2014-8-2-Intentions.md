### Intentions
---

I'm hoping to use this site to track what I want to do as well as what I'm doing for a *contining education* benefit for myself.  I've realized as I've grown in my company to be more of a manager and learning Flex, that I'm falling behind on some of the latest that JavaScript has to offer.  

Sure, I've been playing with JavaScript and jQuery for a while now, but there's so much out there that's really appeals to me.  What was previously only available in desktop apps and Flash sites, now seems to be capable of a few frameworks and some JavaScript.  One page applications like [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org) or [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), simple mark up with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), and everything that[ Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) have to offer.  

I think the focus now will be on Angular.js and Meteor, but we'll see what comes up in the next few months.

Thanks to [Adam p's Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [Barry Clark's post on Jekyll and GitHub blogs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) for getting me started on this.
